This project focuses on bringing all data structures and algorithms in one place. Feel free to contribute to this repository and make sure to follow the guidelines.

# How to Contribute
* Have a look at open issues, they contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan to be implemented.
* You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
* Fork the repository.
* Clone the repo. to your local system.
* Add the codes that you want to contribute in the respective folder
* Make another Development branch. (Apart from main branch).
* Open the pull request.
* Resolve conflicts ( if any ).

# Where to upload the files
* Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in Python, it goes inside the DS folder within the Python folder and so on)
* **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
* Make sure to go through the issue and PR template before contributing
