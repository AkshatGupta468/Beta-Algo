# OverView
This project focuses on bringing all data structures and algorithms in one place. Feel free to contribute to this repository and make sure to follow the guidelines.

# How to Contribute
* Have a look at open issues, they contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan to be implemented.
* You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
* Fork the repository.
* Clone the repo. to your local system.
* Add the codes that you want to contribute in the respective folder
* Make another Development branch. (Apart from main branch).
* Open the pull request.
* Resolve conflicts ( if any ).

# Where to upload the files
* Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in Python, it goes inside the DS folder within the Python folder and so on)
* **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.

# Contributing Guidelines
- **All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR**.
- **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed**. Any PR that is found to be suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned on a first come first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Add relevant comments explaining what the code is all about (if possible write the Time and Space complexities)
- Code should be properly formatted and indented
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue, and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
