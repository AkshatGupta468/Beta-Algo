# Contributing Guidelines
- **All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR**.
- **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed**. Any PR that is found to be suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned on a first come first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Add relevant comments explaining what the code is all about (if possible write the Time and Space complexities)
- Code should be properly formatted and indented
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue, and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- Make sure to go through the [issue template](https://github.com/Rj-coder-iitian/Beta-Algo/issues/1) and [PR template](https://github.com/Rj-coder-iitian/Beta-Algo/issues/2) before contributing and use these templates whenever making a issue/PR. 

For any issues feel free to contact on our emails ([rj17@iitbbs.ac.in](rj17@iitbbs.ac.in) & [ag41@iitbbs.ac.in](ag41@iitbbs.ac.in)).
